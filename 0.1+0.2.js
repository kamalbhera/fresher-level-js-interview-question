// what will the output?
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
// output: 0.30000000000000004

// what the hack? I was thinking 0.3 would be the output
// by the way the result of this operation in any language will be same as above
// why
// as decimal number base is 10
// but we know computer compute in base 2
// so computer have to do so many conversion
// that's why sometimes computer do mistakes to calculates this kind of calculations but not for every calculations
